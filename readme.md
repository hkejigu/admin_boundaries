##ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE BOUNDARIES


1. Zimbabwe is divided into PROVINCES for administrative purposes. The provinces are subdivided into DISTRICTS which are further divided into WARDS. Read more on this structure from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Zimbabwe). 

2. This repository contains three(3) datasets pertaining administrative boundaries of Zimbabwe as polygon features. Please read on for data specific metadata. For general repository structure refer to this project's [Webpage](http://zimgeospatial.github.io/) which gives an explanation of other files in this repository. 

3. **This project has adopted the use of P-Codes ([explained here](http://geocode-encyclopedia.info/p_code)) to assign codes to the data. It is highly recommended that reference be made to the P-Codes 'dictionary' in the [reference repository.](https://giâ™ thub.com/zimgeospatial/reference)** These are individual CSV files that can be sercahed within github.

4. The basis of the admin boundaries has been wards data [**admin_level3_wards.x**] as obtained from [humanitarianresponse](http://www.humanitarianresponse.info/operations/zimbabwe/dataset/zimbabwe-admin-level-3-boundaries) dated January 2008.
